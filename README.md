# Healthee
# General description
In this day and age, there are more and more causes that can do harm to humans, an example of which is the COVID-19 currently raging all over the world as a test to our immune systems. This fact raises the importance of health maintenance. Seeing this problem, our team has decided to create Healthee with a view to helping people approach a healthier life. 
Healthee’s main purposes are not only to provide the users with a convenient platform that guides them to a more balanced daily diet but also to inform them of what (chemical ingredients) are actually inside their food and which are good for their health. 
If shoppers want to know the nutrition value of a particular food about to be bought at the supermarket, they just need to run the application, start the searching section, type in the name of a product on the Search Bar, for example, an apple, and the app will present the nutrition value of an ideal apple. This helps the users keep track of what and how many nutrients they consume in their bodies every day. The app can also filter out profitable and harmful food for the users according to their health information input when they first log-in to the app. Harmful food will be blurred. 
Moreover, if the users are not sure about how their diet should be, they can ask the app to guide them to a balanced daily diet according to their health status. Or they can create their diet calendars themselves, then the app presents their diet’s nutritional value as well as reminds them to stick to their diet every day.
We also intend to develop this app for QR-Barcode Scan as an additional feature. Then the users can choose between two options to search for information on a product – typing into SearchBar and QR-Barcode Scan.
